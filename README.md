I am an AI Enthusiast, I do frontend development and I write technical articles on the side. I really enjoy bringing designs and UI to life with frontend and I love doing this with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (React). I avail myself with different resources and knowledge on new frameworks and languages as I love to learn and share what I have learnt. Some of my favorite frameworks/libraries includes, Tailwind.css, Chakra UI, Framer Motion and Next.js etc.

I am currently intrigued in contributing to opensource and creating contents to help beginners... If you want to find out more about my interests, passions and activities, then please follow me on

Skills: NEXT /REACT / JS / HTML / CSS
